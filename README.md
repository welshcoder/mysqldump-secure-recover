# mysqldump-secure-recover
Small shell script to assist with the decryption and decompression of files created with mysqldump-secure.

## Requirements
Should be pretty portable for other systems that can run `sh` shell scripts. `openssl` is required if decryption is required, and the relevant (de)compression software should be installed if that is needed.

## Usage

`mysqldump-secure-recover [-h|--help] --in=<file> [--key=<keyfile>] [--out=<file>]`

> -h, --help - display the help message
>
> --in=<file> - this is the file generated by mysqldump-secure that you want to recover.
>
> --key=<file> - the the file containing the private key to decrypt an encrypted input file.
>
> --out=<file> - this is the output to generate. If not supplied, the output goes to stdout.
